## About
The Human Centric Health project seeks to produce tooling to support the means through which people are able to be supported to be the primary interested parties and stakeholders, in & of, their own health and welfare.  The project will also look at how to improve supports for persons involved privately in persons lifes, such as parters, parents and guardians; and in-turn also, deliver outcomes that intended to transformationally improve the capacities of clinicians to do their job, honourably and well; whilst also, forming supports for persons should that have not been the case whether by (honest) mistake, or in relation to circustances that are worse than mearly being unfortunate.

This project effectively culminates an array of underlying works that have been undertaken over decades.  

Whether and how this project progresses is presently unknown. Nonetheless, its being worked on in good faith & on a best-efforts basis.

## Areas of Interest
There's several aspects to these deliberations that form part of an ecosystems focused approach.  Part of the higher-order goals, is about ensuring people have inalienable rights in relation to their biometrics, bio-ai, bio-data and 'digital transformation' related informatics.

Particular interest is in areas of social justice and improvement of healthcare supports and outcomes for persons, through the use of advanced technologically aided approaches.  In relation to this goal, the means for people to engage with clinicians in good faith and on a more fulsome basis; with the beneficial supports that can be made available through the use of technology, for both stakeholder groups to make use of evidence more effectively, is an integral part of that goal. 

Another critical area that is sought to be advanced overtime, is the means to support natural precision medicine. This is a non-trivial objective, and is in-turn linked to the support and advanced employment of various forms of traditional medicine, whilst also linked to the employment of advanced, so-called 'western' biosciences and related capacities.  

## Areas presently 'out of scope'.
It is understood that there are a range of advanced biomedically employable capacities to augment natural hosts (human beings) and their biological characteristics at various levels, through the use of advanced methodologies, such as gene editing and other areas of extreme complexity.  It is understood that these areas of advancement give rise to furnishing the technical means to address serious disorders relating to genetic and/or immunological factors, alongside the many other areas.  It is amongst my hopes and desires to see problems such as adolesent diabetes - cured; and, whilst there are many, many areas associated with related considerations; for the time-being (2025) these sorts of pursuits are presently out of scope.

However; it is expected that the consequence of the works sought to be done, will help persons irraspective of their condition(s). 

## Engineering to address complex challenges.
Information Systems Technologies have impactful consequences upon persons and groups of persons, in various ways.  Some of the most significant areas of concern relates to the sancity of our humanity and in-turn, related foundational rights.  These issues already disaffect persons in many ways, most often - without a great deal of comprehension of it.  One of the many areas of importance, is the means through which persons are supported as to maintain rights in relation to self, related constituencies, derivatives & insights, in whatsoever medium they be produced and/or recorded. This is presently a problem with regard to relatively basic bio-informatics, and this problem is sought to be sufficiently addressed prior to the resolution of 'mind', consciousness, being advanced beyond 'safe levels'.

This in-turn requires consideration about the difference between rights, trade, agreements, commons and property, as are moreover constituencies of a far broader series of qualities and characteristics, associated with these highly sophistocated challenges.

Therein; and as is consequential, the intended body of works seeks to employ particular methodologies, designs and paradigms that are considered suitable for experimentation in relation to means through which progress is sought to be made, in a 'fit for purpose' manner.

## Resources
The underpinnings of this project, has an array of electronic / informational assets that have been collated overtime, alongside related works.  

The project does not have much in the way of financial resources; and, whilst prior works have involved various people around the world over a long period of time, there is not presently many specifically involved in this project specifically...  

## Notes

### IPR & Historical Implications
It is important to note, that the means through which efforts have been undertaken as to seek to resolve an outcome where people 'own' their own 'thoughtware', the electronic recordings of their minds & lived experiences; has led to many conflicts with IPR (intellectual property rights) strategies and frameworks employed by public & private sector entities historically, alongside the structure of common-place obligations in relation to employment and leadership of organisations, particularly in relation to software related projects.  Fundamentally, human rights were considered to be 'out of scope', whilst the focus has been on the protection of organisations via the activities of what people do, even if those structures poorly impact (other) human(s). 

### Stepping Stone Projects
The notion of a 'stepping stone' project, is about the development of a project that may not appear to be a Health Project, but is undertaken to address a complex problem that needs further consideration prior to being employed for Health related purposes; or, is associated to and/or with, health or project related intents & purposes. 

For Instance; there is a range of functionality that i sought to be brought about to ensure that persons have the means to manage personal information in a manner that is decoupled or loosely coupled only - to 3rd party (IE: Web 2.0) platforms.  Efforts to address these objectives will in-turn lead to works relating to 'social web' functionality; which may in-turn also, act to support further works that seek to address the economic needs of participants, and the means through which parties are then able to support compensatory methods for producers of useful works, as noted otherwise below...  Yet, the broader underlying principle is that the works seek to address a variety of issues considered to be undesirable when seeking to best support the health & wellbeing of persons & groups of persons.

### Obligation Free (Software)
An objective is to establish a framework / ecossystems tooling through which 'obligation free' software (in particular, whilst not exclusively) is able to be brought about.  This involves ensuring means to extinguish 'digital slavery' related supply chain problems, where people doing good work for humanity are too often expected to do so sacrificially; whilst also, seeking to cap compensatory mechanisms, establish 'obligation costs' associated to useful works, projects and derivatives; and then, seek to support means for accessible use & availability through to a juncture where obligation costs are met, resulting in obligation free derivatives, such as software.

### Royalty Free, Patent Pool supported open-standards
Where possible, works will seek to employ, support or advance open-standards.

### Semantics (web / internet)
The methodology will seek to employ W3C Semantic Web related works and tooling; and then also, seek to advance these works where usefully necessary.  It is presently, too often the case, that electronic document encoding fails to support internet (or web) level namespacing. 

Historically, these works were developed as supports for the 'web of data', a WWW related term.  Advancements in relation to protocols since, have brought about means through which many of these underlying works can be employed in new and innovative ways, to address both old & emergent problems. Whilst these methodologies are certainly, more complicated, it is also considered to be the only 'fit for purpose' approach.

### Project Language
Whilst an attempt to support the meaningfully significant importance of ensuring supports for all languages of prayer, all mother tongue languages; the attempt led to divertion of attentions, in a way that resulted in very little else being done, whilst also, failing to make meaningful progress to achieve even simply, that goal. It is hoped this challenge will be addressed in future; and certainly, some of the tooling sought to be developed to do so, has meaningful utility in relation to these works also.  Nonetheless, the work language is sought to be the english language, with accomadation for the various regional dialects of it.

### 'Decentralisation'
The term 'decentralisation' (or 'decentralization') can be used with many different real-world meanings and implications. Presently, the best description i can provide is one of 'entity relations', whereby there are moral rules, expectations and/or obligations, relating persons (or entities) with knowledge, or information.  The means to achieve better systems and/or supports via modern ICT / software, is presently limited and sought to be a foundationally important issue to be addressed; both, via stepping stone projects alongside HCH software RD&D (research, Development & Demonstration) generally.  Consequentially, it is expected to be the case that persons seeking to become most involved in useful works will need personal computing hardware that is able to operate the software, based on these forms of architectual principles.  It is expected that the cost and specialisation of these forms of hardware devices / components, will reduce & become commonplace overtime.  

These considerations apply to usecases impacting both 'patients and practitioners'... 

### Future Docs
Work to develop a better document website is intended to be done at some-stage in the future.


## Disclaimer
In consideration of laws that have been formed with the stated purpose of seeking to protect the health and wellfare of persons, this project and its deriative works to produce otherwise unavailable software and related means to gain insights and health & welfare, must not be considered to be a form of health product, service or similar as required by law to ensure support for the health & welfare of persons.

As Researchers, developers and people with time to work on hypothesis and similar; your use of any tooling produced or considered by these works is considered recreational and users should rely upon qualified medical professionals for matters of importance for their health. 

Should these circumstance and related considerations change for any related works, information about that will be expressly noted wherever it is.  whilst the intent & purpose of works is to seek to do good in areas otherwise unsupported, where unsupported, works should be considered art, not supported officially in any way by medical industry organisations, policies, etc. until / unless, that becomes so, at some later time.

Note Also: Some works may be undertaken via means and methodologies that have a degree of separation, as to protect from bad-actors who may otherwise seek to obstruct progress on the basis that effort is being made in relation to a desire to address health related problems.
